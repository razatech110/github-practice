    <img src="./islamabad.jpeg" length="400px">
    <p>Islamabad (/ɪzˈlɑːməbæd/ ⓘ;[6] Urdu: اسلام‌آباد, romanized: Islāmābād, lit. 'City of Islam', [ɪsˈlɑːmɑːbɑːd] ⓘ) is the capital city of Pakistan.[7][8] It is the country's tenth-most populous city with a population of over 1.1 million, and is federally administered by the Pakistani government as part of the Islamabad Capital Territory. Built as a planned city in the 1960s and established in 1967, it replaced Karachi as Pakistan's national capital.

The Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis developed Islamabad's master plan, in which he divided it into eight zones; the city comprises administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational and industrial sectors, commercial areas, as well as rural and green areas administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation with support from the Capital Development Authority. Islamabad is known for its parks and forests, including the Margalla Hills National Park and the Shakarparian. It is home to several landmarks, including the country's flagship Faisal Mosque. Other prominent landmarks include the Pakistan Monument and Democracy Square.[9][10][11]

Rated as Gamma + by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network,[12] Islamabad has one of the highest costs of living in Pakistan. The city's populace is dominated by both middle- and upper-middle-class citizens.[13][14] Islamabad is home to more than twenty universities, including Bahria University, Quaid-e-Azam University, PIEAS, COMSATS University, and NUST. It is also rated as one of the safest cities in Pakistan and has an expansive RFID-enabled surveillance system with almost 2,000 active CCTV cameras.[15][16]</p>

 <p>Daman-e-Koh (Urdu: دامن کوہ) is a hilltop garden north of Islamabad. It is in the center of the Margalla Hills. The name is a fusion of two Persian words "Dāman" (دامن) meaning "skirt" and "Kōh" (کوہ) meaning "hill", which collectively denote "foothills". It is about 2400 ft above sea level and about 500 ft above Islamabad. The area is a popular destination for both residents and tourists.[1]

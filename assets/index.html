            <h3>History of Pakistan</h3>
        </u></em>
    <p>The history of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan began on 14 August 1947 when the country came into being in the
        form of the Dominion of Pakistan within the British Commonwealth as the result of the Pakistan Movement and the
        partition of India. While the history of the Pakistani nation according to the Pakistan government's official
        chronology started with the Islamic rule over Indian subcontinent by Muhammad ibn al-Qasim which reached its
        zenith during Mughal era.[1] In 1947, Pakistan consisted of West Pakistan (today's Pakistan) and East Pakistan
        (today's Bangladesh). The President of All-India Muslim League and later the Pakistan Muslim League, Muhammad
        Ali Jinnah became Governor-General while the secretary general of the Muslim League, Liaquat Ali Khan became
        Prime Minister. The constitution of 1956 made Pakistan an Islamic democratic country.

        Pakistan faced a civil war and Indian military intervention in 1971 resulting in the secession of East Pakistan
        as the new country of Bangladesh. The country has also unresolved territorial disputes with India, resulting in
        four conflicts. Pakistan was closely tied to the United States in the Cold War. In the Afghan–Soviet War, it
        supported the Afghan mujahideen and played a vital role in the defeat of Soviet Forces and forced them to
        withdraw from Afghanistan. The country continues to face challenging problems including terrorism, poverty,
        illiteracy, corruption and political instability. Terrorism due to war on terror damaged the country's economy
        and infrastructure to a great extent from 2001 to 2009 but Pakistan is once again developing.

        Pakistan is a nuclear power as well as a declared nuclear-weapon state, having conducted six nuclear tests in
        response to five nuclear tests of their rival Republic of India in May 1998. The first five tests were conducted
        on 28 May and the sixth one on 30 May. With this status, Pakistan is seventh in world, second in South Asia and
        the only country in the Islamic World. Pakistan also has the sixth-largest standing armed forces in the world
        and is spending a major amount of its budget on defense. Pakistan is the founding member of the OIC, the SAARC
        and the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition as well as a member of many international organisations
        including the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Commonwealth of Nations, the ARF, the Economic
        Cooperation Organization and many more.

        Pakistan is a middle power which is ranked among the emerging and growth-leading economies of the world and is
        backed by one of the world's largest and fastest-growing middle class. It has a semi-industrialized economy with
        a well-integrated agriculture sector. It is identified as one of the Next Eleven, a group of eleven countries
        that, along with the BRICs, have a high potential to become the world's largest economies in the 21st century.
        Although Pakistan faced a severe economic crisis from 2022 to 2024, geographically Pakistan is an important
        country and a source of contact between Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia and East Asia.</p> <br>

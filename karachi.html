<img src="./musem2.jpg" width="300px">
<p>Pakistan Air Force Museum Faisal (Urdu: پاک فضائیہ عجائب گھر) is the official museum of the Pakistan Air Force located on the south-western edge of PAF Base Faisal near Karsaz Flyover on Shahrah-e-Faisal at Karachi.

The museum is the only military aviation museum in Pakistan, with more than 50 aircraft, radars and missiles on display. The museum draws thousands of visitors each day making it one of the most frequently visited tourist attractions in Karachi.[1][2][3][4][5]

<h3>History</h3>
The Museum dates back to the time of colonial rule when two hangars were erected by the British in the remote part of PAF Base Drigh Road which through the years were abandoned. In the years that followed, then Base commander of Faisal Airbase (Abbas Khattak) suggested an idea of establishing a museum to preserve the history of the air force. The museum was established in 1990 under the supervision of Air Commodore (retd) Usman Ghani who renovated the old hangar and developed the barren area. Between 1999 and 2004, the museum was expanded significantly. Additions included children's playing areas, rides, and eateries.[3][2]</p><br>

<img src="./mohata.jpg" width="300px">
<p>The Mohatta Palace (Urdu: موہٹا پیلس) is a museum located in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. Designed by Ahmed Hussain Agha,[1] the palace was built in 1927 in the posh seaside locale of Clifton as the summer home of Shivratan Mohatta, a Hindu Marwari businessman from what is now the modern-day Indian state of Rajasthan. The palace was built in the tradition of stone palaces of Rajasthan, using pink Jodhpur stone in combination with the local yellow stone from nearby Gizri. Mohatta could enjoy this building for only about two decades before the partition of India, after which he left Karachi for the new state of India.

<h5>Background</h5>
Shivratan Chandraratan Mohatta was a Hindu Marwari businessman, who traced his roots in Bikaner, Rajasthan, his recorded ancestry began with Motilal Mohata (spelled Mohatta in English), who migrated in 1842 from Bikaner to Hyderabad (in Telangana, India) to become a clerk in a shop.[2] His four children migrated to Calcutta and became leading merchants of imported cloth. One of them, Govardhan Mohta, moved to Karachi in 1883. His older son, Ramgopal, became a scholar and author.[3] Karachi's Hindu Gymkhana building, officially known as the Seth Ramgopal Goverdhandas Mohatta Hindu Gymkhana was named after this son.[4] Govardhan Mohta's younger son Shivrattan became an industrialist in Karachi, and made his fortune from the manufacturing of palm olive soap.[5]</p><br>
